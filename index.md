# Goals

* Have a generic API for handling common tasks across multiple file storage engines.
* Have consistent output which you can rely on.
* Integrate well with other packages/frameworks.
* Be cacheable.
* Emulate directories in systems that support none, like AwsS3.
* Support third party plugins.
* Make it easy to test your filesystem interactions.
* Support streams for big file handling
